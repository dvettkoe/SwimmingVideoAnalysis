# SwimmingVideoAnalysis
A custom python-based program for the analysis of swimming cycles of C. elegans. Using Swimming Video Analysis allows to combine and delete tracks after automated tracking by "wrmTrck". The software opens annotated video files and displays respective tracks. It allows to find specific tracks anywhere in the video only by a click of the user.
